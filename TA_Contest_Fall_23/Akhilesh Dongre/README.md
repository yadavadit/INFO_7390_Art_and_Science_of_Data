# Week 1: Information Visualization - Foundations and Data Analysis

Welcome to Week 1 of the Information Visualization course! In this week, we will cover the foundational concepts of information visualization, data abstraction, fundamental graphs, data transformation, graphical components, mapping strategies, basic data statistics, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

## Course Content

### 1. Information Visualization: Foundations, Data Abstraction
- Introduction to information visualization and its importance.
- Understanding data abstraction and its role in effective visualization.
- Exploring the Titanic dataset as our example data.

### 2. Fundamental Graphs and Data Transformation
- Learn about fundamental types of graphs: histograms, scatter plots, bar plots, etc.
- Apply data transformation techniques to prepare data for visualization.
- Example: Visualizing the age distribution of Titanic passengers using a histogram.

### 3. Graphical Components and Mapping Strategies
- Understand graphical components like color, size, shape, etc., for conveying information.
- Explore mapping strategies for mapping data to visual properties.
- Example: Creating a count plot to visualize the distribution of passenger classes.

### 4. Basic Data Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Learn the importance of understanding basic data statistics before visualization.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, outliers, and relationships.
- Example: Calculating summary statistics and generating a correlation matrix for Titanic dataset.
